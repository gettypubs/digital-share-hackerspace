### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for formatting documents.
It doesn't require any special program to use -- all markdown files are really just _plain text_.

> The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as
> possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain
> text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.
